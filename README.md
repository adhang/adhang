### Welcome to my GitHub repository!
- My name is Adhang, I'm from Indonesia
- I started getting to know Machine Learning when I was in college. Since then, I loves to explore Data Science and Machine Learning.
- I used this platform as a place to share my projects and documentations
- I'm not an expert yet, but I always have a big curiosity to learn more.
- Right now, I'm still looking for an opportunity to work in the data field.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Hope you have a nice day!
