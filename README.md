## Hi, I'm Adhang ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I started getting to know Machine Learning when I was in college.
Since then, I loves to explore Data Science and Machine Learning.
I'm not an expert yet, but I always have a big curiosity to learn more.

Right now, I'm still looking for an opportunity to work in the data field.
